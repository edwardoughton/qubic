    <h1>Quantified Universal Broadband Investment by Country (Qubic)</h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This country briefing contains estimated investment costs for providing
    universal broadband. The analysis focuses on exploring the impact of different
    technology, infrastructure sharing business models and policy options.
    The required investment is broken down based on the social cost, which is based
    on a combination of the quantity of private sector investment which can be
    viably achieved, with government investment in the form of subsidies making up
    the difference in unviable locations.

    For a detailed description of the method used, please refer to the affiliated
    method document which provides a comprehensive overview of the approach.

<h2>Technology options</h2>
<p>
    There are a variety of technology options available to provide universal broadband
    connectivity. This assessment focuses on assessing cellular technologies (3G, 4G
    and 5G) using licensed spectrum as this is one of the most cost-effective ways to
    provide wide-area broadband connectivity. The cost of building and operating cellular
    sites is not always prohibitive but often in rural and remote areas the challenge
    relates to the ‘backhaul’ connection which links each tower back to a fiber Point
    of Presence, transporting data to and from the wider internet.
</p>
<p>
    Three different scenarios are explored here given different cellphone and smartphone
    adoption rates, for low (2%), baseline (4%) and high (6%) variants. Moreover, three
    capacity per user targets are applied (5, 10 and 20 Mbps) based on the mean speed
    available for the busiest hour of the day.

    Figure 1 illustrates the social cost of different technology strategies in
    providing universal broadband, based on the required private sector and
    government investment to reach 100% population coverage.

<h1>Quantified Universal Broadband Investment by Country (Qubic)</h1>
<h2>Country Assessment for {{ preferred_name }} by Edward Oughton</h2>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This country briefing contains estimated investment costs for providing
    universal broadband. The analysis focuses on exploring the impact of different
    technologies, infrastructure sharing business models and policy options.
    The required investment is broken down based on the social cost, which is a
    combination of the quantity of private sector investment and government subsidies.
    The private sector investment represents the portion that can be viably achieved,
    whereas the government investment in the form of subsidies makes up
    any shortfall in unviable locations.
</p>
<p>
    For a detailed description of the method used, please refer to the affiliated
    method document which provides a comprehensive overview of the approach, as
    applied in a recent World Bank working paper (Oughton et al. 2021a).
</p>
<h2>Technology options</h2>
<p>
    There are a variety of technology options available to provide universal broadband
    connectivity. This assessment focuses on assessing cellular technologies (3G, 4G
    and 5G) using licensed spectrum as this is one of the most cost-effective ways to
    provide wide-area broadband connectivity (Oughton et al. 2021b).
</p>
<p> The cost of building and operating cellular sites is not always prohibitive on its own,
    but often in rural and remote areas a major challenge relates to the cost of building
    the ‘backhaul’ connection. This component links each tower back to a fiber Point of
    Presence, enabling data to be transported to and from the wider Internet. If data needs
    to traverse long distances (especially over irregular terrain), then this can push
    the cost of the backhaul connection up significantly and make deployment unviable.
    This warrants exploration of the costs of different backhaul technologies.
</p>
<p>
    Three different scenarios are explored here given different cellphone and smartphone
    adoption rates, for low (2%), baseline (4%) and high (6%) variants. Moreover, three
    capacity per user targets are applied (~5, ~10 and ~20 Mbps) based on the mean speed
    available for the busiest hour of the day. Figure 1 illustrates the results, with
    the social cost of the different technology strategies tested based on the
    required private sector and government investment to reach 100% population
    coverage.
</p>
<p>
    The results demonstrate that as newer, more spectrally efficient, technologies
    become available, the cost of provision decreases. This is because more
    spectrally efficient technologies enable an increase in the number of bits per
    Hertz (thus, more information) to be transferred, translating to fewer sites being
    required to meet the desired capacity per user targets. As fewer sites are
    required for newer generations relative to older ones (e.g. 5G relative to 3G),
    this technically leads to reduced cost (subject to the caveats discussed later,
    regarding users actually having enabled devices).
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, newer technologies often have better quality coverage spectrum
    relative to older generations, such as when comparing 3G to 4G. Moreover,
    with 5G there is the benefit of having both good quality coverage spectrum
    (700 MHz), as well as very wide bandwidth in the 3.5 GHz band, enabling large
    capacity increases.
</p>
<p>
    For example, to deliver a mean capacity per user of ~10 Mbps in the baseline,
    3G (W) requires {{ upgraded_sites_baseline_10mbps_3g_w }} upgraded sites and
    {{ new_sites_baseline_10mbps_3g_w }} new sites, based on 3G using 'Single In,
    Single Out' (SISO) radio technology. This compares with 4G requiring
    {{ upgraded_sites_baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} upgraded sites and
    {{ new_sites_baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} new sites, based on 4G using 2x2 'Multiple In,
    Multiple Out' (MIMO) radio technology. Finally, with 5G gaining a significant
    capacity boost from using 4x4 MIMO, this strategy requires
    {{ upgraded_sites_baseline_10mbps_5g_w }} upgraded sites and
    {{ new_sites_baseline_10mbps_5g_w }} new sites.
</p>
<p>
    As the MIMO level has a large impact on the cost results, this technology
    deserves attention. Just imagine in practical terms that the MIMO level
    reflects the number of streams of simultaneously transmitted information
    sent over a radio channel. This is achieved thanks to 'multipath propagation',
    where radio waves can take many different paths between the site antenna and the
    receiving antenna on a user's smartphone. Newer devices are clever enough to
    detect these simultaneous streams thanks to the use of multiple antennas.
    The only caveat is that generally for this technique to enable additional
    capacity gains, the user needs to be close enough to the cell site to
    achieve a strong radio signal.
</p>

<h3>Figure 1 Assessment of universal broadband technology strategies</h3>

<img src="{{ figure_1 }}">
<p>
    When comparing the required investment across strategies in the baseline, using
    wireless backhaul to deliver ~10 Mbps per user, 3G is estimated to cost
    ${{ baseline_10mbps_3g_w }} billion, versus a 4G cost of ${{ baseline_10mbps_4g_w }}
    billion and a 5G cost of ${{ baseline_10mbps_5g_w }} billion.
</p>
<p>
    The scenario variants help to capture the uncertainty around future cellphone and
    smartphone adoption, and the potential impact on the social cost. For example,
    providing ~10 Mbps per user with a wireless backhaul ranges for 3G from
    ${{ low_10mbps_3g_w }} billion to ${{ high_10mbps_3g_w }} billion, for 4G from
    ${{ low_10mbps_4g_w }} billion to ${{ high_10mbps_4g_w }} billion, and for 5G
    from ${{ low_10mbps_5g_w }} billion to ${{ high_10mbps_5g_w }} billion.
</p>
<p>
    It is equally important to capture the impact of varying the universal broadband
    targets, which in this case are highly ambitious, ranging from a conservative ~5 Mbps,
    up to ~20 Mbps per user. This translates to a baseline cost using wireless
    backhaul of ${{ baseline_5mbps_3g_w }} billion (~5 Mbps) to ${{ baseline_20mbps_3g_w }}
    billion (~20 Mbps) for 3G, ${{ baseline_5mbps_4g_w }} billion (~5 Mbps) to
    ${{ baseline_20mbps_4g_w }} billion (~20 Mbps) for 4G, and finally
    ${{ baseline_5mbps_5g_w }} billion (~5 Mbps) to ${{ baseline_20mbps_5g_w }}
    billion (~20 Mbps) for 5G. This generational improvement reflects the combination
    of greater spectral efficiency and wider spectrum bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
    <b>There are a number of caveats to these results.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Firstly, users would need to have either 4G- or 5G-enabled smartphones in
    order to make use of these technologies. Given that handset prices for newer
    generations are more expensive, this weakens the case for leapfrogging to newer
    generations. The most sensible current option is to target universal deployment
    of 4G, which has favorable technological characteristics, combined with the
    ability for users to acquire increasingly cheaper 4G-enabled smartphones (below
    US$50).
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, these are the costs for a single generation to be deployed on the
    existing available infrastructure. In reality, an operator would need to be
    running multiple generations at once (such as 2G, 3G and 4G, potentially with
    5G in the future), often with the use of multi-carrier base stations. This
    combined spectrum usage may make it harder to reduce the number of sites
    being used, if there is still an ambition to provide coverage via earlier
    generations of cellular technologies. However, over the next decade, it will
    become increasingly common that operators choose to shutdown older generations
    such as 2G or 3G (although this is likely to be in high-income frontier
    markets where consumers have progressively moved to newer generations such as 4G).
</p>
<p>
    The use of different backhaul technologies has a large impact on investment.
    While fiber optic backhaul links are highly desirable thanks to their large capacity,
    the reality is that this option costs much more than using a wireless connection (using
    either microwave or millimeter wave frequencies). Fiber also takes much longer to deploy,
    relative to a wireless link. For example, when deploying wireless rather than fiber, a
    saving can be achieved of {{ w_over_fb_3g_10mbps }}% for 3G, {{ w_over_fb_4g_10mbps }}%
    for 4G and {{ w_over_fb_5g_10mbps }}% for 5G, when targeting ~10 Mbps per user.

    Given how large the investment would need to be in order to deploy fiber to every site,
    the most probable future for providing universal broadband will continue to include the
    use of wireless backhaul connections between the cell site and the closest connection
    point (due to advantages in cost efficiency and deployment speed).
</p>

<h2>Infrastructure sharing options</h2>

<p>
    Four different infrastructure sharing strategies are assessed to provide insight into
    the infrastructure business models which could be employed to help reduce the
    necessary investment cost. These range from each operator building and running
    their own separate network in the baseline, through to sharing different passive
    and active infrastructure assets with other service providers.
</p>
<p>
    Passive sharing focuses on multiple operators using the same site compound, tower and
    backhaul connection (thus, non-electronic components). Whereas active sharing is the
    introduction of a Multi-Operator Radio Access Network (MORAN), where the active
    electronic radio equipment is shared simultaneously along with the passive
    infrastructure assets. Finally, as both passive and active sharing strategies are
    nationally homogenous in their level of sharing across urban and rural markets,
    a Shared Rural Network (SRN) focuses on deploying an actively-shared MORAN, but
    only in rural areas where the economics of deployment are generally more challenging.
    This preserves competition in capacity-constrained urban areas. If required, see
    the method document for additional information.
</p>
<p>
    Figure 2 reports the relative differences across the sharing strategies, as they
    translate to cost savings, using 4G with a wireless backhaul as the common
    deployment strategy. The variation across the scenarios and capacity
    targets will be similar to the results reported in Figure 1, therefore the
    focus here will be on business model options.
</p>
<p>
    Between the baseline and the passive sharing strategies, a percentage saving of
    approximately {{ passive_vs_base_4g_10mbps }}% is estimated in the baseline,
    when targeting ~10 Mbps per user. This equates to a reduction from
    ${{ baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} billion to ${{ passive_cost_4g_10mbps }}
    billion.
</p>

<h3>Figure 2 Assessment of universal broadband infrastructure sharing strategies</h3>

<img src="{{ figure_2 }}">

<p>
    This contrasts with a much more substantial savings from moving to an actively-shared
    MORAN, where the cost relative to the baseline is estimated to reduce by up to
    {{ active_vs_base_4g_10mbps }}%. This relates to a reduction from the baseline cost
    of ${{ baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} billion to ${{ active_cost_4g_10mbps }} billion.
</p>
<p>
    The caveat to these aforementioned strategies is that they could end up compromising
    the level of market-based infrastructure competition between operators, which is well
    documented to provide beneficial consumer outcomes. The aim of the SRN is to try to
    balance out these benefits by retaining market-based infrastructure competition in
    urban areas, while reducing the deployment costs in rural areas. When considering
    the cost saving provided for sharing in rural areas, based on using 4G (W) and a
    wireless backhaul, the cost drops from the baseline investment of
    ${{ baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} billion to ${{ srn_cost_4g_10mbps }} billion, equating
    to an approximate {{ srn_vs_base_4g_10mbps }}% saving.
</p>
<p>
    Regulators need to make a judgement call based on their preferred direction. On the one
    hand, increased infrastructure sharing can help to reduce the costs of deployment,
    while on the other, there is a balancing act in terms of the level of competition
    desired between operators, especially as this market dynamic can lead to stronger
    investment outcomes. If such a strategy is of interest to pursue, it is wise
    to model the infrastructure sharing implications based on actual operator data, rather
    than using the hypothetical operator approach adopted here.
</p>

<h2>Policy options</h2>

<p>
    A set of policy options are assessed to help support regulatory decisions at the
    national level.
</p>
<p>
    The two previous sections  focused on technologies and infrastructure sharing
    business models. The decisions associated with these options will ultimately be
    taken by private operators, particularly as governments increasingly adopt a technology
    neutral policy approach. However, it is essential for governments
    to have a strategic understanding of how different strategies perform, given their
    role in managing market rules and public resources, such as radio spectrum.
</p>
<p>
    For example, governments need to help encourage the technologies operators will deploy
    by understanding which general market direction to set, including identifying and
    releasing relevant spectrum bands. Moreover, governments need to help set an
    acceptable level of infrastructure sharing (if any), given the trade-off with
    market competition benefits.
</p>

<h3>Figure 3 Assessment of universal broadband policy strategies</h3>

<img src="{{ figure_3 }}">

<p>
    To complete this national assessment, the focus of this policy section is on both
    taxation and spectrum licensing costs.
    In terms of the strategies tested, a baseline is used which matches the
    existing spectrum prices and corporation tax rates reported in both Figures 1
    and 2 using 4G with a wireless backhaul. The new policy strategies explore a reduction
    in the corporation tax rate on profits to {{tax_low}}% (Low Tax), versus a
    situation where this rate is raised to {{tax_high}}% (High Tax). This is relative
    to a baseline of {{tax_baseline}}%. Figure 3 presents the results generated from
    testing these strategies.
</p>
<p>
    The results find a cost decrease of approximately {{perc_lowtax}}% in
    the Low Tax option for the baseline adoption scenario targeting a mean of ~10
    Mbps per user. This equates to a decrease from ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}}
    billion to ${{lowtax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion. This contrasts with a High Tax
    case with a cost increase of approximately {{perc_hightax}}%, meaning the
    baseline cost rose from ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion to
    {{hightax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
</p>
<p>
    As the model focuses on deploying universal broadband via user-cross
    subsidization (akin to a universal service obligation), profits above
    {{profit_margin}}% are reallocated to serving unviable areas. Therefore,
    corporation tax rate changes have a more modest impact than if there was
    no minimum service target and operators could maximize profits from only
    viable urban and suburban areas (leaving rural areas with poor coverage).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the spectrum license fees are varied to explore the cost sensitivity
    of this option. In the Low Spectrum Fees case, the existing cost of
    ${{spectrum_coverage_baseline_usd_mhz_pop}} per MHz/population for coverage
    spectrum and ${{spectrum_capacity_baseline_usd_mhz_pop}} per MHz/population
    for capacity spectrum, is decreased by {{spectrum_cost_low}}%. This led to a
    cost decrease from the baseline of ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion to
    ${{lowspectrum_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, the cost of spectrum is increased by {{spectrum_cost_high}}% in
    the High Spectrum Fees case. This leads to an increase in the required
    investment from a baseline of ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion to
    ${{highspectrum_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
</p>
<p>
    The magnitude of these cost changes very much relate to the cost of spectrum
    in each country. For example, some countries are notorious for having very
    high spectrum costs which is stated to reduce available capital for
    infrastructure deployment in unviable locations.
</p>
<p>
    Quantifying the social cost in this way, based on the composition of the
    private and the government cost, is important. It demonstrates that in
    nationally unviable markets, where there is not enough revenue to support
    universal coverage, there is little benefit from allocating high taxes.
    For example, for every $1 taken in tax revenue via the private cost, equates
    to a $1 subsidy required by government in unviable areas.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, it is worth governments exploring the use of universal coverage
    obligations to help push out broadband service to unviable areas, while also
    being prudent about the use of taxation and spectrum licensing fees. Based on
    the modeling approach used in this analysis, the results suggest no net benefit
    is derived from these revenue raising activities in markets where universal
    broadband cannot be viably achieved.

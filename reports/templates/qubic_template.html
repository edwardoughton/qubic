<h1>Quantified Universal Broadband Investment by Country (Qubic)</h1>
<h2>Country Assessment for {{preferred_name}} by Edward Oughton</h2>
</head>
<body>
<p align="justify">
    The first part of this country briefing contains estimated investment costs for providing
    universal broadband in {{preferred_name}}. The analysis focuses on exploring
    the impact of different technologies, infrastructure sharing business models and policy options.
    For further detail, the second part provides an overview of the method and model
    inputs, with a separate document providing the mathematical description of the model.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The required investment is broken down based on the financial cost, which is a
    combination of the quantity of private sector investment and government subsidies
    (minus any government tax revenues). The private sector investment represents the
    portion that can be viably achieved through private actors, such as Mobile Network
    Operators, and usually represents the majority of the capital required. In contrast,
    the net government investment (after accounting for tax and spectrum
    licensing revenues) represents any public subsidies required to make up
    capital shortfall in unviable locations, and is usually only a small portion of
    the overall cost.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The results demonstrate that providing governments make judicious choices, adopting fiscal
    and regulatory regimes that are conducive to lowering costs, universal broadband may be
    within reach of most countries over the next decade.
</p>

<h2>Technology options</h2>

<p align="justify">
    There are a variety of technology options available to provide universal broadband
    connectivity. This assessment focuses on evaluating cellular technologies (3G, 4G
    and 5G) using licensed spectrum as this is one of the most cost-effective ways to
    provide wide-area broadband connectivity (Oughton et al. 2021b).
</p>
<p align="justify"> The cost of building and operating cellular sites is not always
    prohibitive on its own,
    but often in rural and remote areas a major challenge relates to the cost of building
    the ‘backhaul’ connection. This component links each tower back to a fiber Point of
    Presence, enabling data to be transported to and from the wider Internet. If data needs
    to traverse long distances (especially over irregular terrain), then this can push
    the cost of the backhaul connection up significantly and make rural deployment unviable.
    This warrants exploration of the costs of different backhaul technologies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Three different scenarios are explored here given different cellphone and smartphone
    adoption growth rates, for low (2%), baseline (4%) and high (6%) variants. Moreover, three
    capacity per user targets are applied (~2, ~5, and ~10 Mbps) based on the mean speed
    available for the busiest hour of the day. Figure 1 illustrates the results, with
    the social cost of the different technology strategies tested based on the
    required private sector and government investment to reach 100% population
    coverage.
</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
    'Cost' is defined as the Net Present Value (NPV) of the Total Cost of
    Ownership (TCO) over the next decade, 2020-2030, aligning with the horizon of the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (specifically target SDG 9c on universal
    affordable broadband access).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The results demonstrate that as newer, more spectrally efficient, technologies
    become available, the cost of provision decreases. This is because more
    spectrally efficient technologies enable an increase in the number of bits per
    Hertz (thus, more information) to be transferred, translating to fewer sites being
    required to meet the desired capacity per user targets. As fewer sites are
    required for newer generations relative to older ones (e.g. 5G relative to 3G),
    this technically leads to reduced cost (subject to the caveats discussed later,
    regarding users actually having enabled devices).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Additionally, newer technologies often have better quality coverage spectrum
    relative to older generations, such as when comparing 3G to 4G. Moreover,
    with 5G there is the benefit of having both good quality coverage spectrum
    (700 MHz), and when used, very wide bandwidth in the 3.5 GHz band
    enabling large capacity increases close to the cell site.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    A key factor determining the capacity provided by each generation is the number
    of antennas the cell and user cellphone have. In 3G most cells use 'Single In,
    Single Out' (SISO) radio technology, so essentially a transmitter and receiver.
    This contrasts with 4G which is commonly deployed with 2x2 'Multiple In, Multiple
    Out' (MIMO) radio technology, using two transmitter and receiver antennas. In 5G,
    much higher order MIMO is possible, although here only 4x4 MIMO is assumed.
    As the MIMO level has a large impact on the cost results,
    this technology deserves attention. Just imagine in practical terms that the MIMO
    level reflects the number of streams of simultaneously transmitted information
    sent over a radio channel. This is achieved thanks to 'multipath propagation',
    where radio waves can take many different routes between the site antenna and the
    receiving antenna on a user's smartphone. Newer devices are clever enough to
    detect these simultaneous streams thanks to the use of multiple antennas, enabling
    impressive capacity gains.
</p>

<h3>Figure 1 Assessment of universal broadband technology strategies</h3>
<img src="{{ figure_1 }}", width="auto", height="auto">

<p align="justify">
    When comparing the required investment across strategies in the baseline, using
    wireless backhaul to deliver ~5 Mbps per user, 3G is estimated to cost
    ${{ baseline_5mbps_3g_w }} billion
    (private: {{perc_private_base_5mbps_3g_w}}%, public:
    {{perc_govt_base_5mbps_3g_w}}%),
    versus a 4G cost of ${{ baseline_5mbps_4g_w }}
    billion (private: {{perc_private_base_5mbps_4g_w}}%, public:
    {{perc_govt_base_5mbps_4g_w}}%)
    and a 5G cost of ${{ baseline_5mbps_5g_w }} billion
    (private: {{perc_private_base_5mbps_5g_w}}%, public:
    {{perc_govt_base_5mbps_5g_w}}%).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The scenario variants help to capture the uncertainty around future cellphone and
    smartphone adoption, and the potential impact on the social cost. For example,
    between the low and the high adoption scenarios, providing ~5 Mbps per user
    with a wireless backhaul ranges for 3G from
    ${{low_5mbps_3g_w}}-{{high_5mbps_3g_w}} billion, for 4G from
    ${{low_5mbps_4g_w}}-{{high_5mbps_4g_w}} billion, and for 5G
    from ${{low_5mbps_5g_w}}-{{high_5mbps_5g_w}} billion. If in some circumstances
    the social cost is lower when there is higher adoption, this arises because there
    is more available revenue to support private sector investment, reducing the need
    for government subidies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    It is equally important to capture the impact of varying the universal broadband
    targets, which in this case are ambitious, ranging from a conservative ~2 Mbps,
    up to ~10 Mbps per user. This translates to a baseline cost using wireless
    backhaul of ${{ baseline_2mbps_3g_w }}-{{ baseline_10mbps_3g_w }}
    billion for 3G, ${{ baseline_2mbps_4g_w }}-{{ baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} billion for 4G,
    and finally ${{ baseline_2mbps_5g_w }}-{{ baseline_10mbps_5g_w }}
    billion for 5G. This generational improvement reflects the combination
    of greater spectral efficiency and wider spectrum bandwidth.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    There are a number of caveats to these results.
    Firstly, users would need to have either 4G- or 5G-enabled smartphones in
    order to make use of these technologies. Given that handset prices for newer
    generations are more expensive, this weakens the case for leapfrogging to newer
    generations. The most sensible current option is to target universal deployment
    of 4G, which has favorable technological characteristics, combined with the
    ability for users to acquire increasingly cheaper 4G-enabled smartphones (below
    US$50).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Secondly, these are the costs for a single generation to be deployed on the
    existing available infrastructure. In reality, an operator would need to be
    running multiple generations at once (such as 2G, 3G and 4G, potentially with
    5G in the future), often with the use of multi-carrier base stations. This
    combined spectrum usage may make it harder to reduce the number of sites
    being used, if there is still an ambition to provide coverage via earlier
    generations of cellular technologies. However, over the next decade, it will
    become increasingly common that operators choose to shutdown older generations
    such as 2G or 3G (although this is likely to be in high-income frontier
    markets where consumers have progressively moved to newer generations such as 4G).
</p>

<h3>Figure 2 Assessment of universal broadband technology strategies</h3>
<img src="{{ figure_2 }}", width="auto", height="auto">

<p align="justify">
    The use of different backhaul technologies has a large impact on investment.
    While fiber optic backhaul links are highly desirable thanks to their large capacity,
    the reality is that this option costs much more than using a wireless connection (using
    either microwave or millimeter wave frequencies), and fiber also takes much longer to
    deploy. For example, when deploying wireless rather than fiber, a cost
    saving can be achieved of {{ w_over_fb_3g_10mbps }}% for 3G, {{ w_over_fb_4g_10mbps }}%
    for 4G and {{ w_over_fb_5g_10mbps }}% for 5G, when targeting ~10 Mbps per user.
    Figure 2 illustrates the percentage composition of the private cost across the different
    strategies and capacity per user targets, for the baseline adoption scenario.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Figure 2 captures the capex and opex proportion required for the RAN, backhaul
    and core, as well as the one-off capex requirement for any civil engineering costs.
    The other balance sheet components cover MNO operational costs (opex) such as
    administration, spectrum licensing, taxation and a profit margin.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Across the technology strategies, Figure 2 demonstrates that the percentage composition
    of the backhaul and core network components is larger in the fiber strategy, relative
    to using wireless backhaul. This percentage composition needs to be considered in tandem
    with the absolute values of investment presented in Figure 1. Given how large the
    investment would need to be in order to deploy fiber to every site, the most probable
    future for providing
    universal broadband will continue to include the use of wireless backhaul connections
    between the cell site and the closest connection point (due to advantages in cost
    efficiency and deployment speed).
</p>

<p align="justify">
        The financial costs of each capacity target are further visualized spatially in
        Appendix 1 for 4G using wireless backhaul.
    </p>

<h2>Infrastructure sharing options</h2>

<p align="justify">
    Four different infrastructure sharing strategies are assessed to provide insight into
    the infrastructure business models which could be employed to help reduce the
    necessary investment cost. These range from each operator building and running
    their own separate network in the baseline, through to sharing different passive
    and active infrastructure assets with other service providers.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Passive sharing focuses on multiple operators using the same site compound, tower and
    backhaul connection (thus, non-electronic components). Whereas active sharing is the
    introduction of a Multi-Operator Radio Access Network (MORAN), where the active
    electronic radio equipment is shared simultaneously along with the passive
    infrastructure assets. Finally, as both passive and active sharing strategies are
    nationally homogenous in their level of sharing across urban and rural markets,
    a Shared Rural Network (SRN) focuses on deploying an actively-shared MORAN, but
    only in rural areas where the economics of deployment are generally more challenging.
    This preserves competition in capacity-constrained urban areas. If required, see
    the method document for additional information.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Figure 3 reports the relative differences across the sharing strategies, as they
    translate to cost savings, using 4G with a wireless backhaul as the common
    deployment strategy. The variation across the scenarios and capacity
    targets will be similar to the results reported in Figure 1, therefore the
    focus here will be on business model options.

</p>
<p align="justify">
    Between the baseline and the passive sharing strategies, a percentage saving of
    approximately {{passive_vs_base_4g_10mbps}}% is estimated when targeting ~10 Mbps
    per user. This equates to a reduction from ${{baseline_10mbps_4g_w}} billion to
    ${{passive_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion. When considering other capacity targets,
    a percentage saving against the baseline is estimated of approximately
    {{passive_vs_base_4g_5mbps}}% for ~5 Mbps and {{passive_vs_base_4g_2mbps}}% for
    ~2 Mbps.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    This contrasts with a much more substantial saving from moving to an actively-shared
    MORAN, where the cost relative to the baseline is estimated to reduce by up to
    {{active_vs_base_4g_10mbps}}% for ~10 Mbps. This relates to a reduction from the baseline
    cost from ${{baseline_10mbps_4g_w}} billion to ${{active_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
    For a target of only ~5 Mbps, a saving against the baseline of
    {{active_vs_base_4g_5mbps}}% is estimated, or a {{active_vs_base_4g_2mbps}}%
    saving for ~2 Mbps.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The caveat to these aforementioned strategies is that they could end up compromising
    the level of market-based infrastructure competition between operators, which is well
    documented to provide beneficial consumer outcomes. The aim of the SRN is to try to
    balance out these benefits by retaining market-based infrastructure competition in
    urban areas, while reducing the deployment costs in rural areas. When considering
    the cost saving provided for sharing in rural areas, based on using 4G and a
    wireless backhaul to deliver ~10 Mbps per user, the cost drops from the baseline
    investment from ${{ baseline_10mbps_4g_w }} billion to ${{ srn_cost_4g_10mbps }} billion,
    equating to an approximate {{srn_vs_base_4g_10mbps}}% saving. In the ~5 Mbps per user case
    the saving was {{srn_vs_base_4g_5mbps }}%, versus an approximate {{srn_vs_base_4g_2mbps }}%
    saving when aiming to deliver ~2 Mbps per user.
</p>

<h3>Figure 3 Assessment of universal broadband infrastructure sharing strategies</h3>
<img src="{{ figure_3 }}", width="auto", height="auto">

<p align="justify">
    Regulators need to make a judgement call based on their preferred direction. On the one
    hand, increased infrastructure sharing can help to reduce the costs of deployment,
    while on the other, there is a balancing act in terms of the level of competition
    desired between operators, especially as this market dynamic can lead to stronger
    investment outcomes. If such a strategy is of interest to pursue, it is wise
    to model the infrastructure sharing implications based on actual operator data, rather
    than using the hypothetical operator approach adopted here.
</p>

<h2>Policy options</h2>

<p align="justify">
    A set of policy options are assessed to help support regulatory decisions at the
    national level.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The two previous sections  focused on technologies and infrastructure sharing
    business models. The decisions associated with these options will ultimately be
    taken by private operators, particularly as governments increasingly adopt a technology
    neutral policy approach. However, it is essential for governments
    to have a strategic understanding of how different strategies perform, given their
    role in managing market rules and public resources, such as radio spectrum.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    For example, governments need to help encourage the technologies operators will deploy
    by understanding which general market direction to set, including identifying and
    releasing relevant spectrum bands. Moreover, governments need to help set an
    acceptable level of infrastructure sharing (if any), given the trade-off with
    market competition benefits.
</p>

<h3>Figure 4 Assessment of universal broadband policy strategies</h3>
<img src="{{ figure_4 }}", width="auto", height="auto">

<p align="justify">
    To complete this national assessment, the focus of this policy section is on
    taxation and spectrum licensing costs.
    In terms of the strategies tested, a baseline is used for 4G with a wireless backhaul
    which matches the existing spectrum prices and corporation tax rate used.
    The new policy strategies explore a reduction
    in the corporation tax rate on profits to {{tax_low}}% (Low Tax), versus a
    situation where this rate is raised to {{tax_high}}% (High Tax). This is relative
    to a taxation baseline assumption of {{tax_baseline}}%, which is broadly aligned with
    the corporation tax rate for {{preferred_name}}. Figure 4 presents the results
    generated from testing these strategies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The results find a cost decrease of approximately {{perc_lowtax}}% in
    the Low Tax option for the baseline adoption scenario targeting a mean of ~10
    Mbps per user. This equates to a decrease from ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}}
    billion to ${{lowtax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion. This contrasts with a High Tax
    case with a cost increase of approximately {{perc_hightax}}%, meaning the
    baseline cost rose from ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion to
    {{hightax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    As the model focuses on deploying universal broadband via user-cross
    subsidization (akin to a universal service obligation), return on capital
    invested above {{profit_margin}}% is reallocated to serving unviable areas.
    Therefore, corporation tax rate changes have a more modest impact than if
    there was no minimum service target and operators could maximize profits
    from only viable urban and suburban areas (leaving rural areas with
    poor coverage).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Similarly, the spectrum license fees are varied to explore the cost sensitivity
    of this option. Analysis of the PointTopic spectrum database is used to inform
    spectrum price assumptions for each country, for coverage (below 1 GHz) and
    capacity (over 1 GHz) spectrum bands. In the Low Spectrum Fees case, the
    existing cost of ${{spectrum_coverage_baseline_usd_mhz_pop}} per MHz/population
    for coverage spectrum and ${{spectrum_capacity_baseline_usd_mhz_pop}} per
    MHz/population for capacity spectrum, is decreased by {{spectrum_cost_low}}%.
    This led to a cost decrease from the baseline of ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}}
    billion to ${{lowspectrum_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In contrast, the cost of spectrum is increased by {{spectrum_cost_high}}% in
    the High Spectrum Fees case. This leads to an increase in the required
    investment from a baseline of ${{baselinetax_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion to
    ${{highspectrum_cost_4g_10mbps}} billion.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The magnitude of these cost changes very much relate to the cost of spectrum
    in each country. For example, some countries are notorious for having very
    high spectrum costs which is stated to reduce available capital for
    infrastructure deployment in unviable locations.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Quantifying the social cost in this way, based on the composition of the
    private and the government cost, is important. It demonstrates that in
    nationally unviable markets, where there is not enough revenue to support
    universal coverage, there is little benefit from allocating high taxes.
    For example, for every $1 taken in tax revenue via the private cost, equates
    to a $1 subsidy required by government in unviable areas.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Therefore, it is worth governments exploring the use of universal coverage
    obligations to help push out broadband service to unviable areas, while also
    being prudent about the use of taxation and spectrum licensing fees. Based on
    the modeling approach used in this analysis, the results suggest no net benefit
    is derived from these revenue raising activities in markets where universal
    broadband cannot be viably achieved.

    <h2>Qubic Method for {{preferred_name}}</h2>
</pdf:nextpage>

</head>
<body>
<p align="justify">
    Policy decisions require transparent and reproducible analytics.
    However, there are many policy reports that fail to explicitly report their
    method and assumptions for the whole policy community
    (both industry and government) to scrutinize and evaluate.
    The method presented in this document directly addresses the
    current reproducibility crises which exists with many pieces of
    policy evidence, particularly in the field of broadband assessment
    and telecommunication policy.
</p>
<p align="justify">
        In the Qubic project,
        the method provides an innovative analytical approach which combines the
        use of remote sensing and least-cost infrastructure network designs, with
        traditional telecommunications regulatory assessment techniques. This
        method builds off the previous open-source codebases developed, including
        the Policy Options for Digital Infrastructure Strategies (podis) (Oughton, 2021)
        and the Python Telecommunications Assessment Library (Oughton, 2020)
        repositories, both of which adhere to gold-standard software engineering
        methods (being fully-tested and fully-documented). Both are openly available
        from the repository for all to access.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    A ‘what-if’ scenario approach is adopted enabling different questions
    pertaining to universal broadband to be tested. In scientific research
    areas where considerable uncertainties exist, and we lack comprehensive
    scientific information, a common approach is to use scenario analysis.
    Quantitative models are developed which can be explored in different ways,
    enabling comparative analytics to be developed against different potential
    futures. Decision makers in industry and government can then use these results
    as discussion tools to develop strategic insight on an important matter,
    such as universal broadband connectivity.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    An important caveat is that the Qubic work does not explicitly model a
    single operator’s spectrum and asset portfolio, market share etc.,
    instead focusing on modeling a ‘hypothetical operator’ with an average
    quantity of sunk costs and users. Explicitly modeling an operator’s
    supply and demand conditions can be challenging due to a lack of available
    data. Even if comprehensive information is available, explicit modeling
    often raises commercially sensitive issues which can hinder engagement
    with industry. Therefore, this approach is considered superior, but comes
    with the caveat that the model inputs purposefully do not
    match any of the operators currently active in the market (as is common in
    decision analytics for telecom regulation).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In the field of infrastructure modeling, a standard methodological approach
    consists of three distinct steps. Firstly, a demand module is developed
    which uses past data combined with forecasts to produce plausible scenarios
    of future change over a study period (e.g. the next decade, up to 2030).
    Secondly, a supply-side infrastructure module is developed which designs
    different network configurations, for different technologies, based on a
    least-cost algorithmic approach. Finally, an assessment model is used to
    apply different industry decisions or government policies, to quantitatively
    represent the implications of the strategic options available. Before a
    description of these three stages is presented, with regard to the open-source
    model developed, a method for clustering similar countries into groups will
    first be articulated.
</p>

<h2>Country clustering</h2>

<p align="justify">
    We do not always have complete evidence for all countries in the world which makes
    it challenging to undertake systematic cross-country analysis. Often survey data
    from one country, could be used to inform other countries, providing a suitable
    comparison can be made. Country-to-country variation needs to be controlled for
    in this process. Therefore, in this assessment a representative set of country
    clusters is developed for all 135 emerging economies by using a k-means clustering
    approach based on four key metrics which affect the supply and demand of broadband
    infrastructure.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Firstly, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita represents the economic
    purchasing power of consumers, and secondly, population density represents
    the general spatial distribution of humans living in a particular country
    (World Bank, 2020). Thirdly, 4G coverage provides insight into the level of
    existing availability of telecom infrastructure and wireless broadband
    availability, and finally, the penetration rate for unique cellphone subscribers
    is used (recognizing that many people own multiple SIM cards, therefore
    the unique number of users is required) (GSMA, 2020). While these metrics
    are by no means a fully comprehensive set of country indicators, it is
    preferable to use a small number of metrics when clustering. This keeps the
    analysis as explainable as possible (e.g. for why certain countries are in
    each cluster), as well as keeping any illustrations visually succinct (e.g.
    making it possible to visualize the inputs and results in a single set of
    plots). Figure 1 reports the mean centered results of the clustering process,
    along with the six different country segments selected.
</p>

<h3>Figure 1 K-means clustering results for each country grouping</h3>
<img src="{{figure_m1}}", width="auto", height="auto">

<p align="justify">
    To avoid overcomplicating this assessment, high-income countries are excluded
    as the focus of this analysis is Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs).
    Due to the unique geographic characteristics of very small countries, we drop
    those under 5,000 square kilometers, so the focus can be on providing wide-area
    access in challenging deployment conditions. This generally excludes very small
    islands, such as Grenada, Saint Lucia, or The Maldives. Countries with very
    high population density (over 5,000 inhabitants per square kilometer) are also
    excluded as these nations have favorable economic conditions that may not
    warrant the type of universal broadband analysis carried out in this assessment.
    The exact R code uses the inbuilt kmeans function from the R stats package and
    is available for inspection in the Qubic code repository
    (Oughton, 2021).
</p>

<h2>Open-source engineering-economic model</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The modeling techniques have been applied to many countries around the world,
    with the foundations of the method developed for national 5G assessments in
    mainly OECD markets, such as the UK (Oughton et al., 2018; Oughton and Frias, 2018,
    2016; Oughton and Russell, 2020) and the Netherlands (Oughton et al., 2019),
    as well as India, the world's largest mobile market (Oughton and Jha, 2021).
    More recently, the methods have been deployed in the Pytal and Podis
    repositories. Figure 2 visualizes the assessment method, divided into the
    three software modules.

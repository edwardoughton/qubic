<h1>Quantified Universal Broadband Investment by Country (Qubic)</h1>
<h2>Qubic Method for {{preferred_name}} by Edward Oughton</h2>
</head>
<body>
<p align="justify">
    Policy decisions require transparent and reproducible analytics.
    However, there are many policy reports that fail to explicitly report their
    method and assumptions for the whole policy community
    (both industry and government) to scrutinize and evaluate.
    The method presented in this document directly addresses the
    current reproducibility crises which exists with many pieces of
    policy evidence, particularly in the field of broadband assessment
    and telecommunication policy.
</p>
<p align="justify">
        In the Quantified Universal Broadband Investment by Country (Qubic) project,
        the method provides an innovative analytical approach which combines the
        use of remote sensing and least-cost infrastructure network designs, with
        traditional telecommunications regulatory assessment techniques. This
        method builds off the previous open-source codebases developed, including
        the Policy Options for Digital Infrastructure Strategies (podis) and
        the Python Telecommunications Assessment Library repositories, both of
        which adhere to gold-standard software engineering methods (fully-tested,
        fully-documented) and are available openly from the repository for all
        to access.
    </p>
<p align="justify">
    A ‘what-if’ scenario approach is adopted enabling different questions
    pertaining to universal broadband to be tested. In scientific research
    areas where considerable uncertainties exist, and we lack comprehensive
    scientific information, a common approach is to use scenario analysis.
    Quantitative models are developed which can be explored in different ways,
    enabling comparative analytics to be developed against different potential
    futures. Decision makers in industry and government can then use these results
    as discussion tools to develop strategic insight on an important matter,
    such as universal broadband connectivity.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    An important caveat is that the Qubic work does not explicitly model a
    single operator’s spectrum and asset portfolio, market share etc.,
    instead focusing on modeling a ‘hypothetical operator’ with an average
    quantity of sunk costs and users. Explicitly modeling an operator’s
    supply and demand conditions can be challenging due to a lack of available
    data. Even if comprehensive information was available, explicit modeling
    often raises commercially sensitive issues which can hinder engagement
    with industry. Therefore, this approach is considered superior, but comes
    with the caveat that the model inputs will purposefully not identically
    match any of the operators currently active in the market (as is common in
    decision analytics for telecom regulation).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In the field of infrastructure modeling, a standard methodological approach
    consists of three distinct steps. Firstly, a demand module is developed
    which uses past data combined with forecasts to produce plausible scenarios
    of future change over a study period (e.g. the next decade, up to 2030).
    Secondly, a supply-side infrastructure module is developed which designs
    different network configurations, for different technologies, based on a
    least-cost algorithmic approach. Finally, an assessment model is used to
    apply different industry decisions or government policies, to quantitatively
    represent the implications of the strategic options available. Before a
    description of these three stages is presented, with regard to the open-source
    model developed, a method for clustering similar countries into groups will
    first be articulated.
</p>

<h2>Country clustering</h2>

<p align="justify">
    We do not always have complete evidence for all countries in the world which makes
    it challenging to undertake systematic cross-country analysis. Often survey data
    from one country, could be used to inform other countries, providing a suitable
    comparison can be made. Country-to-country variation needs to be controlled for
    in this process. Therefore, in this assessment a representative set of country
    clusters is developed for all 135 emerging economies by using a k-means clustering
    approach based on four key metrics which affect the supply and demand of broadband
    infrastructure.
</p>
<p align="justify">
        Firstly, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita represents the economic
        purchasing power of consumers, and secondly, population density represents
        the general spatial distribution of humans living in a particular country
        (World Bank, 2020). Thirdly, 4G coverage provides insight into the level of
        existing availability of telecom infrastructure and wireless broadband
        availability, and finally, the penetration rate for unique cellphone subscribers
        is used (recognizing that as many people multiple SIM cards, therefore
        the unique number of users is required) (GSMA, 2020). While these metrics
        are by no means a fully comprehensive set of country indicators, it is
        preferable to use a small number of metrics when clustering. This keeps the
        analysis as explainable as possible (e.g. for why certain countries are in
        each cluster), as well as keeping any illustrations visually succinct (e.g.
        making it possible to visualize the inputs and results in a single set of
        plots). Figure 1 reports the mean centered results of the clustering process,
        along with the six different country segments selected.
</p>


<h3>Figure 1 K-means clustering results for each country grouping</h3>

<p align="justify">
    To avoid overcomplicating this assessment, high-income countries are excluded
    as the focus of this analysis is Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs).
    Due to the unique geographic characteristics of very small countries, we drop
    those under 5,000 square kilometers, so the focus can be on providing wide-area
    access in challenging deployment conditions. This generally excludes very small
    islands, such as Grenada, Saint Lucia, or The Maldives. Countries with very
    high population density (over 5,000 inhabitants per square kilometer) are also
    excluded as these nations have favorable economic conditions that may not
    warrant the type of universal broadband analysis carried out in this assessment
    (such as Lebanon). The exact R code uses the inbuilt kmeans function from the
    R stats package and is available for inspection in the Qubic code repository
    (Oughton, 2021).
</p>

<h2>Open-source engineering-economic model</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The modeling techniques have been applied to many countries around the world,
    with the foundations of the method developed for national 5G assessments in
    OECD markets, such as the UK (Oughton et al., 2018; Oughton and Frias, 2018,
    2016; Oughton and Russell, 2020) and the Netherlands (Oughton et al., 2019).
    More recently, the methods have been deployed in the Pytal and Podis
    repositories. Figure 2 visualizes the assessment method, divided into the
    three software modules, which will now be presented.

<h2>Demand module</h2>

The demand module uses a variety of data inputs. For a detailed description of
the mathematical model, see the affiliated document.
